The application needed to updated to be web based\n\n### Solution\n\nThis application was rebuilt entirely using Azure for the backend and Vue for the front end. It is based on a 20+ page Word Document and over 100 Figma screens. This application was highly complex due to the number of rules and regulations. Users needed a more straightforward way to create and edit reservations. The paths must be as straightforward as possible to minimize potential user errors.\n\nInitial query\n![Initial query](./images/reservations.webp)\n\nTrip builder\n![Trip builder](./images/reservations-build.webp)\n\nCheckout\n![checkout](./images/reservations-checkout.webp)\n";
