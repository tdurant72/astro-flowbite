# Client Eagles RFC


## The Challenge

For Eagles RFC, a youth soccer club, their biggest problem wasn't a lack of talent or coaches; it was a lack of visibility. Despite a strong local reputation, their website was buried on the 9th page of Google for the crucial search term, "youth soccer club Greensboro." With tryouts approaching, they were essentially invisible to new families looking for a club, leaving them unable to drive registrations and grow their roster.

### The Solution

We didn't just redesign their website; we transformed it into a powerful marketing and recruitment tool. The strategy focused on a two-pronged approach:

1. **Massive SEO Lift:** We started with a full-scale SEO overhaul. After a deep competitive analysis, we optimized their site's metadata and content, targeting the exact keywords their ideal customers were using. The result was a win that changed the game: **We moved the Eagles RFC website from the 9th page to the 1st page of Google search results in just 30 days.**

2. **Clearer Messaging and Conversion:** With new visibility, we had to make sure the site was ready to convert. We helped the club define and showcase their unique core values, creating a powerful emotional connection with visitors. The language on the site was simplified to lower the barrier to entry for parents, and we redesigned the user experience to make the path to signing up for tryouts clear and frictionless.

## The Outcome
The project wasn't just about a new look; it was about delivering a measurable business result. By achieving first-page search ranking and creating a compelling, user-friendly site, we helped Eagles RFC get in front of hundreds of new families. The redesign delivered the visibility they desperately needed, directly translating into more interest, more sign-ups, and a stronger position in the competitive youth sports market.
