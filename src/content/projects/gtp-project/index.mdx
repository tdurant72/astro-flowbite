# Client: North Carolina Global TransPark


## The Challenge

The North Carolina Global TransPark is a massive, 2,500 acre asset with a dual mission: attract major industrial clients and demonstrate value to taxpayers. The previous digital presence failed on both fronts. It didn't effectively market the unique benefits of the park to business leaders, nor did it provide the necessary transparency to the public. The challenge was to build a single platform that could simultaneously act as a high-powered sales tool and a transparent public resource.

## The Solution
We designed and built a new digital platform that put the Global TransPark's value proposition front and center. The solution focused on two key audiences: the prospective corporate client and the North Carolina taxpayer.

**_For the Client:_** We created a compelling visual experience with a dual video hero section. One video showcased the business advantages of the park, and the other highlighted the high quality of life in Eastern North Carolina. The goal was to sell a complete package: a business opportunity and a place to thrive. We provided interactive, detailed parcel maps with all the critical data a site selector would need, turning the website into a powerful lead-generation tool.

**_For the Public_** We built dedicated pages that provided full transparency on operations, leadership, and public private partnerships. This section of the site was designed to be easily updated, ensuring the public could always see how their investment was being managed and the economic impact it was creating.

## The Outcome
The new platform transformed the Global TransPark's website from a static brochure into an active sales and transparency engine. By clearly segmenting and addressing the needs of both key audiences, we delivered a tool that now not only drives new business inquiries but also builds public trust and confidence. The result is a site that delivers on both of its core mandates: attracting investment and proving ROI to the people of North Carolina.
