# Client: NCDOT Bidding & Letting


## The Challenge
The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) was stuck in the past. Their Bidding & Letting process was entirely paper based, slow, and frustrating. Businesses and contractors had to manually call in to request paper packets for contracts, and there was no way to get automatic updates on changes. This wasn't just an inconvenience; it was a barrier to entry, stifling competition and making the process inefficient for both the government and the businesses that wanted to work with it.

### The Solution

We designed and built a comprehensive digital platform that transformed the entire bidding process. The solution was built to be a central hub for contractors, moving the system from a manual, analog process to an automated, digital one.

The core of the solution focused on two critical functions:

- Seamless Discovery & Tracking: We created a user friendly site with advanced search functionality. Businesses can now easily find contracts by specific parameters, eliminating the need for phone calls and mailing packets.

- Automated Communication: We implemented an automated notification system. Now, once a business registers its interest in a specific contract, it receives real-time updates on any changes. This ensures contractors never miss a critical update, saving time and reducing risk.

## The Outcome
This project didn't just build a new website; it created a more efficient and transparent way for businesses to engage with the government. The new platform streamlined a clunky, outdated process, making it faster and fairer for everyone. By providing businesses with a single source of truth and automated updates, we helped the NCDOT foster more competition, ultimately leading to a more dynamic and competitive marketplace for state contracts.
