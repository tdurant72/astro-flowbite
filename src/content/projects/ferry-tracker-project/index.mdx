# Client: NCFerry

## The Challenge
For years, travelers and commuters in North Carolina had no way to track ferry movements in real time. They were left to guess arrival times, with no access to vital information like terminal statuses or local weather. This lack of transparency led to frustrated passengers, inefficient travel, and a major headache for the state's transportation system. The NCDOT needed a solution to bring their ferry system into the modern age, providing a clear, real-time tool for citizens.

## The Solution
We designed and built a comprehensive mobile first web application that completely solved the problem of real-time ferry tracking. Our solution was engineered to be a single source of truth for travelers, providing a unified, user friendly experience across all devices.

The platform was built with key user needs in mind:

- **Real-Time Tracking:** The core functionality was a live map that showed the location, direction, and estimated arrival time of every ferry.

- **Integrated Terminal Data:** We included terminal specific information, such as real-time weather conditions and instant news updates pulled directly from official Twitter feeds.

- **Complete Transparency:** Travelers could easily access all ferry schedules, capacity information, and special advisories in one place.

## The Outcome
We successfully delivered a fully functional, forward thinking platform that was ready for deployment. Our solution demonstrated how a digital product could solve a major logistical challenge and vastly improve the traveler experience. The project serves as a clear example of our ability to build a complex, data driven application that addresses a critical public need with a clean, intuitive design.
