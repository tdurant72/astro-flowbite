## Reservations

A redesign and deveopment of a desktop installed application for making and editing reservations.

### Need

This original application was over 10 years old and a C++ application that was a desktop install. The application needed to updated to be web based

### Solution

This application was rebuilt entirely using Azure for the backend and Vue for the front end. It is based on a 20+ page Word Document and over 100 Figma screens. This application was highly complex due to the number of rules and regulations. Users needed a more straightforward way to create and edit reservations. The paths must be as straightforward as possible to minimize potential user errors.
